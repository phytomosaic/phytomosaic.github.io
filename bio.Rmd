# Bio
******  

Rob Smith is a forest ecologist and ORISE Fellow with the US Forest Service's [Air Resource Management Program](https://www.fs.fed.us/air/index.htm){target="_blank"} in Washington, DC.  He aims to guide forest management by forecasting vegetation responses to pressing global changes, especially where atmospheric stressors and disturbances intersect.  Rob's work lies at the broad intersection of forest ecology, biogeography and high-dimensional statistics.  He contributes to the [National Atmospheric Deposition Program](http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/){target="_blank"}, an interagency cooperative which tracks atmospheric conditions and their environmental effects.  Previously he was a researcher with the [USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis](https://www.fs.usda.gov/pnw/program/rma){target="_blank"} program in the Pacific Northwest, and he taught courses in the [Dept of Botany and Plant Pathology](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu){target="_blank"} at Oregon State University after earning his PhD there with a focus on detection and prediction of climate signals using lichen bioindicators.  For a decade he worked in construction, mills, landscaping, and mountaineering.
