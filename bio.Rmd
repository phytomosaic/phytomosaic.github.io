I am an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow with the US Forest Service's [Air Resource Management Program](https://www.fs.fed.us/air/){target="_blank"}.  Formerly I was in the [Dept of Botany and Plant Pathology](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu){target="_blank"} at Oregon State University.  

With colleagues, students and federal land managers, I work at the broad intersection of forest ecology, biogeography and high-dimensional statistics.  Our goal is to forecast plant and lichen responses to pressing global changes.  Through distributed experiments, open-source software development and large-scale national forest inventories, we ask:  

_**How will global changes to atmospheric regimes alter the functioning, persistence and distribution of forest vegetation?**_ 
\  

Our path shapes the questions we ask. The CV says something else, but a more accurate chronology is:  

- Gunpowder/Patapsco watershed, Maryland -- born and raised, worked in landscaping/nurseries  
- north Idaho -- worked landscape construction  
- central Oregon -- worked in a mill and climbed peaks  
- Mount Rainier, Washington -- worked for mountain guides and climbed peaks  
- Mojave/Great Basin, Nevada/California -- desert botany and climbed peaks  
- western Oregon -- got a botany degree and wrote poems  
- eastern Oregon -- surveyed plants for the Forest Service  
- southern Nevada -- got a fire ecology degree and climbed peaks  
- Washington DC -- did forest research from coffeeshops  
- western Oregon, Minnesota, Alaska -- got a forest ecology degree  
- eastern Washington -- did forest research and planted seeds  

Approximately.
